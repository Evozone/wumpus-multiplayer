A multiplayer game featuring Wumpus the monster and Distributed computing. 

This project is a part of the Distributed Computing course at Terna Engineering College, Navi Mumbai. It is a multiplayer game where players can connect to a server and play the game. The game is based on the classic game of Wumpus, where the player has to navigate through a cave and find the gold while avoiding the Wumpus monster. The game is implemented using Java and the server-client architecture. 

This modified version of the game includes a multiplayer feature where multiple players can connect to the server and try to kill the Wumpus the fastest.
